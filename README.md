This repository contains the R code used for the simulations in the paper "A comparative analysis of Phase I dose-finding designs incorporating pharmacokinetics information." The code implements various model-based dose-finding methods, including those that integrate pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and evaluates their performance across different simulation scenarios. It includes scripts for running the simulations, generating figures, and processing the results presented in the manuscript.

We worked on the following environment: R version 4.2.3 (2015-06-18)
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
R must be installed with the following libraries: assertthat_0.2.1, loo_2.8.0, functional_0.6, dplyr_1.1.4, saemix_3.3, npde_3.5, rstan_2.32.6, StanHeaders_2.32.10, deSolve_1.40, cubature_2.1.1, PK_1.3-6, latex2exp_0.9.6, patchwork_1.3.0, ggridges_0.5.6, gridExtra_2.3, ggplot2_3.5.1
